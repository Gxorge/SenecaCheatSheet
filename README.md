# Seneca Cheat Sheet
This is a little tool that gets all the answers for an assignment and formats it so you can read it.
<br>
**Please Note:** This is in very early testing and often won't contain correct answers and is missing some question types.

## !! This probably no-longer works !!
This hasn't been updated in over 3 years, and I don't plan too.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you are <b>logged into Seneca</b> on a suitable browser (this guide will have Chromium-based browsers in-mind) and have .NET Framework 4.8
<br>
This will probably only work on Windows.

## Setup
For this you will just need your identifier token. But first let's download the program.

- Download the ZIP from the releases tab of this GitHub repo.
- Once downloaded, create a new folder and extract the contents into it.
<br>
You've now got the program. Let's get some answers!


## Program Usage 
Now go find a seneca course to do. Once you have got to the start session screen (there should be a button at the bottom with that text):
- Take a look at the URL, it should look something like this: https://app.senecalearning.com/classroom/course/681e2220-1d4e-11e8-b373-d7e35435fc8a/section/a22f2260-1d4f-11e8-b373-d7e35435fc8a/session . You will need 2 values from this
- Open the SenecaCheatSheet.exe file, ignore any anti-virus warnings that may pop up, it is not a virus.
- It will start by asking you for a course id, this is found in the URL right after it says "course/" up until "/section". So it should be "681e2220-1d4e-11e8-b373-d7e35435fc8a"
- Copy that then pase it into the window (by either right clicking or doing CTRL+V) and hit enter!
- Next it will asking for the section id, this is found in the URL right after it says "section/" up until "/session". So it should be "a22f2260-1d4f-11e8-b373-d7e35435fc8a".
- Copy that then pase it into the window (by either right clicking or doing CTRL+V) and hit enter!
- It will then parse the data and open a text file with your answers in them, it should be pretty self explanitory from there.
